add in an "idea miner" or "project idea finder" aspect. I want this to analyze that data, and then output ideas from this data. 
Understood. I'm now processing your request to integrate an "idea miner" or "project idea finder" feature. This may take a moment to configure.

Thinking done
The user wants to add an "idea miner" or "project idea finder" feature that analyzes the conversation data and generates project ideas from it. This is a perfect use case for AI integration!

Based on the conversation data analysis, I can see:

Restaurant tech focus (Toast POS)
Business consulting
Data analysis and automation
Web development
n8n workflows
The idea miner should:

Use AI to analyze the conversation themes and patterns
Generate actionable project ideas based on the data
Categorize ideas by type (automation, integration, web project, etc.)
Provide context about why each idea is relevant
Have an interactive UI component
This requires:

AI SDK integration (I need to call ai_sdk__get_ai_sdk_docs first)
Create a new component for the idea miner
Process the conversation data and themes to create context for AI
Generate ideas using AI models
Display ideas in an engaging UI
Let me start by getting the AI SDK documentation.

Great idea! I'll add an AI-powered "Idea Miner" feature that analyzes the conversation data and generates project ideas. Let me integrate the AI SDK first.
